# Release and Servicing
Releases are versioned according to [Versioning](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/faxu-doc-updates/docs/Versioning.md). Official releases of ONNX Runtime are managed by the core ONNX Runtime team and packages are published roughly quarterly. For package details, see https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/install.html#install. ONNX Runtime releases are backwards-compatible, unless otherwise noted.

Each release has a dedicated release branch, always prefixed with "rel-" Patch releases may be published periodically between full releases and will have their own dedicated release branch. For questions on release process, timing, or other, please use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/discussions).
