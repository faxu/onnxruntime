# Get Started with ONNX Runtime

**ONNX Runtime** is a cross-platform machine learning **inferencing and training accelerator** for models from popular ML/DNN frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, and more.

ONNX Runtime provides computation acceleration through [graph transformations](./resources/graph-optimizations.html) and optimizations, and is able to take advantage of hardware accelerators on a variety of devices through its [Execution Provider interface](./reference/execution-providers).
